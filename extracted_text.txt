Changes in Accounting Policy 
Bank has opted full implementation of NFRS effective from FY 2074/75.Major changes in accounting policies include recognition of interest income of 
loan and advances from cash to accrual basis, recognition, classification, measurement, de-recognition of financial Assets and liability and impairment 
on financial assets. Effect of each change in accounting policy has been disclosed separately in regulatory reserve/statement of distributable profit. 
Change in Accounting policy has been applied retrospectively to the extent possible and utilizing the exemption of related standards in applying so. 

There have been amendments to the existing standards and issuance of new by IASB and applicability of the new Standards has been notified for IFRS. 
But, the amendments and new standards become applicable only when ASB-Nepal pronounces them. The new Standards issued but not yet effective 
up to the date of issuance of the financial statements are set out below. The Bank will adopt these standards when they become effective. 
a. 
IFRS 9- Financial Instruments 
IFRS 9 states a logical principle base to classify financial assets and financial liabilities which is driven by cash flow characteristics and the 
business model in which an assets or liability is held. Further this standard recommends the assessment of impairment based on more timely 
recognition of expected credit losses and entities are required to account for expected credit losses from the initial recognition of financial 
instruments and it lowers the threshold for recognition of full life time expected losses by aligning financial accounting treatment with risk 
management activities. 
IFRS 9 has become effective from 1 January 2018 and has an effect except for the specific non optional carve outs issued by accounting 
standards of Nepal. 
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 
IFRS 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. Few un-funded 
facilities issued by bank, currently classified as contingent liabilities, may fall under insurance contract and have to measure, present and 
disclose accordingly in the financials after it becomes effective. Globally, IFRS 17 is effective for annual period beginning on or after 1 January 
2021. 
A number of new standards and amendments to the existing standards and interpretations issued by IASB will be applicable when ASB Nepal 
incorporates them within NFRS. 


Adoption of Carve-outs 
The 143rd meeting of the Accounting Standard Board, Nepal held on July 15, 2022 (2079 Asar 32) resolved the carve outs in NFRS with the alternative 
treatment and effective period. Bank has opted to use carve outs with alternative treatment specified therein as below: 
Bank’s Treatment 
Bank uses coupon rate as effective interest rate on loan and 
advances. 

NFRS 9 : 
Financial Instruments 
(para 5.4 related to 
effective interest rate) 
Alternative treatment 
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash payments or receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to 
the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the 
amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the 
effective interest rate, an entity shall estimate the expected 
cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the 
financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call, 
and similar options) but shall not consider the expected credit 
losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or 
received unless it is immaterial or impracticable to determine 
reliably, between parties to the contract that are an integral 
part of the effective interest rate (see para B5.4.1-B5.4.3), 
transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. There 
is a presumption that the cash flows and the expected life of a 
group of similar financial instruments can be estimated reliably. 
However, in those rare cases when it is not possible to reliably 
estimate the cash flows or the expected life of a financial 
instrument (or group of financial instruments), the entity shall 
use the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term 
of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments). 





 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bank has computed impairment loss on loans and advances as 
per the norms prescribed by Nepal Rastra Bank and as suggested 
paragraph 5 of carve-outs. All other financial assets has been 
impaired as per the principal stated in paragraph 5 of carve-outs. 
Paragraph 5 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on 
financial assets measured at amortized cost has been 
incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the 
difference between the asset's carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding 
future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted 
at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. 
the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). 
The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either 
directly or through use of an allowance account. The 
amount of the loss shall be recognized in profit or loss.

NFRS 9: Financial 
Instruments 
(para 5.5 Impairment) 
An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether 
there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets measured at amortized cost is impaired. If any 
such evidence exists, the entity shall apply paragraph 5(given 
below) to determine the amount of any impairment loss unless 
the entity is a bank or financial institution registered as per bank 
and financial institution act 2073. Such entities shall measure 
impairment loss on loan and advances as the higher or amount 
derived as per the norms prescribed by Nepal Rastra Bank for 
loan loss provision and amount determined as per paragraph 
5 (given below) and shall apply paragraph 5 (given below) to 
measure the impairment loss on financial assets other than 
loan and advances. The entity shall disclose the impairment 
loss as per this carve-out and amount of impairment loss 
determined as per paragraph 5 (given below) 
Paragraph 5 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on 
financial assets measured at amortized cost has been 
incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the 
difference between the asset's carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding 
future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted 
at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the 
effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The 
carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly 
or through use of an allowance account. The amount of the 
loss shall be recognized in profit or loss. 









Assets and Liabilities are measured at historic cost and income and expenses are recognized on accrual basis unless otherwise stated. Financial 
Assets and Liabilities are measured primarily at either amortized cost or Fair value. Basis of measurement further depends on classification of 
financial assets and liabilities. Details are provided under policy 3.4. 







Subsidiaries are the entities controlled by bank. Bank controls the entity if it has right to variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

The financial statements of Subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements. 
For FY 2078/79, subsidiaries financials are consolidated in Nepal Financial Reporting Standards (NFRSs) as per the unaudited reports provided 
by the management of the company. Opening reserve of the group has been restated by Rs. 24,268,193.38 on Sawan 1, 2077 due to NFRSs. 
The bank's investment in two entities as mentioned in Note 4.10 is in excess of 50% of the paid up capital of those entities. These investments 
were made under the specific directives or policies of the Government and other relevant statutes. 

The bank has invested in equity shares of Sana Kisan Bikas LaghuBitta Bittiya Sanstha Limited, a 'D' class financial institution licensed by 
central bank. Bank holds 22% share of the entity and has significant influence on the financial and operating policy decisions of that entity. 
This associate is in the business of microfinance and the parent has booked a sum of Rs. 69,384,000 as cost in its books of accounts. Associate 
is valued at cost in standalone financial statements. Equity method has been applied for preparing consolidated group financial statements. 

Bank reassess whether it has control if there are changes to one or more elements of control. Changes in bank’s interest in subsidiary that do 
not result in loss of control are accounted as equity transaction. 
3.2.6 Special Purpose Entity (SPE) 
No such entities exist. 
 




Cash and Cash Equivalent 
Cash and cash equivalents include bank notes and coins in hand, unrestricted balances held with banks and highly liquid financial assets with original 
maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value and are used by 
licensed institution in management of its short term commitments. 
Financial assets and Financial Liabilities 
3.4.1 Recognition 
All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized on the trade date, i.e. the date on which the Bank becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. This includes ‘regular way trades. Regular way trade means purchases or sales of financial assets that required 
delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place. 
The classification of financial instruments at the initial recognition depends on their purpose and characteristics and the management’s 
intention in acquiring them. All financial instruments are measured initially at their fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable 
to acquisition or issue of such financial instruments except in the case of such financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss, as per the Nepal Accounting Standard - NAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement). Transaction costs in relation to 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are dealt with the Statement of Profit or Loss. 

Bank classifies it based on its business model for managing the asset and the asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics, as follows: 
a. 
Amortized Cost-a financial asset is measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met: 
i. 
ii. 
The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and 
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding. 


Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income-financial assets are classified and measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if they are held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling financial assets 
Fair Value through Profit or Loss-any financial assets that are not held in one of the two business models mentioned is measured at 
fair value through profit or loss. 
When and only when, an entity changes its business model for managing financial assets it must reclassify all affected financial assets. 

All financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities include 
derivatives (other than derivatives that are financial guarantee contracts or are designated and effective hedging instruments), other liabilities 
held for trading, and liabilities that an entity designates to be measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Initial Measurement 
A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus or minus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. Transaction cost in relation to financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognized in Statement of Profit or Loss. 
Subsequent Measurement 
A financial asset or financial liability is subsequently measured either at fair value or at amortized cost based on the classification of the 
financial asset or liability. Financial asset or liability classified as measured at amortized cost is subsequently measured at amortized cost 
using effective interest rate method. 
The amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at 
initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference 
between that initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment or un-collectability. 
Financial assets classified at fair value are subsequently measured at fair value. The subsequent changes in fair value of financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognized in Statement of Profit or Loss whereas of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income are recognized in other comprehensive income. 

The bank derecognizes a financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flow from the financial assets expire, or it transfers the rights 
to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risk and rewards of the ownership of the financial assets 
are transferred or in which the bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of the ownership and it does not retain 
control of the financial assets. 
On de-recognition of a financial assets, the difference between the carrying amount of the assets (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion 
of the assets derecognized) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new assets obtained less any new liability assumed) 
and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in income or expenditure. Any interest in transferred financial 
assets that qualify for de-recognition that is created or retained by the bank is recognized as a separate assets or liability. 

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or canceled or expired. Where an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The 
difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognized in Statement of Profit or Loss. 

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length 
transaction on the measurement date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk 
The fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy: 
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 valuations are those with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments 
in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable. 
Level 3 portfolios are those where at least one input, which could have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation, is not based on 
observable market data. 
When available, the Bank measures the fair value of an instrument using quoted prices in an active market for that instrument. A market is 
regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an 
arm’s length basis. If a market for a financial instrument is not active, the Bank establishes fair value using a valuation technique. Valuation 
techniques include using recent arm’s length transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties (if available), reference to the current fair 
value of other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analyses. 
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration 
given or received. However, in some cases, the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition may be different to its transaction price. 
If such fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (without modification) 
or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, then the difference is recognized in profit or loss 
on initial recognition of the instrument. In other cases the difference is not recognized in profit or loss immediately but is recognized over the 
life of the instrument on an appropriate basis or when the instrument is redeemed, transferred or sold, or the fair value becomes observable. 



































































 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 





















































All unquoted equity investments are recorded at cost, considering the non-trading of promoter shares up to the date of balance sheet, the 
market price of such shares could not be ascertained with certainty. Hence, these investments are recognized at cost net of impairment, if any.

Financial assets 
At each reporting date the bank assesses the objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired or not. A financial 
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result 
of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of the financial assets or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
Bank has measured impairment loss on loan and advance to customer as the higher of amount derived as per norms prescribed by Nepal 
Rastra Bank for Loan Loss provisioning and amount determined as per Para 63 of NAS39 and shall apply impairment Para 63 of NAS 39 to 
measure the impairment loss on Financial assets other than Loan and advances. 
Additional details of disclosure regarding impairment is presented in 5.11 
Bank uses carve- outs as mentioned in 2.7 above 
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
significant financial difficulty of the borrower 
Default in making due on due date 
breach of contract, such as default or delinquency by a borrower 
the bank, for economic or legal reasons relating to the financial difficulties, grant to the borrower a concession that the lender would not 
otherwise consider 
indication that a borrower will enter bankruptcy; 
disappearance of an active market for a security; or 
Observable data relating to a group of assets such as adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the group or economic 
conditions that correlate with defaults in the group. 
• 
• 
• 
The amount of loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and amount the management considers it as recoverable 
on the basis of financial position of the borrower or issuer and appropriate estimation made by the management. Appropriate provisions for 
possible losses on investments in shares, fixed deposits; and loans and advances have been made. Receivables considered as bad and 
irrecoverable are written off from the books of account and directly charged to Statement of comprehensive income. In addition, for an 
investment in an unquoted equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its book value is objective evidence of impairment. 
Individual Assessment of Impairment 
Bank assess whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually that is significant. An individual measurement of impairment is 
based on management's best estimate of the present value of cash flows that are expected to be received. In estimating these cash flows, 
management made judgments about debtor’s financial position and net realizable value of any underlying collateral. Bank considers individual 
impairment is not significant (Very low average loan size) and cost might exceed the benefit and so individual impairment was not done. 
Collective Assessment of Impairment 
Statistical methods are used to determine impairment losses on a collective basis for homogenous groups of financial assets. 
Bank uses the following method to calculate historical loss experience on collective basis: 
After grouping of loans on the basis of homogeneous risks, the Bank uses net flow rate method. Under this methodology the movement in the 
outstanding balance of customers into default categories over the periods is used to estimate the amount of financial assets that will eventually 
be irrecoverable, as a result of the events occurring before the reporting date. 
Under this methodology, loans are grouped into ranges according to the number of days in arrears and statistical analysis is used to estimate 
the likelihood that loans in each range will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately prove irrecoverable. 

Bank writes off loan or investment either partially or in full and related allowance for impairment losses when it determined that there will be 
no realistic prospect of recovery. 
Non-financial assets 
Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not 
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost and value in use. An impairment loss is recognized in Statement of profit 
and loss. Provisions against impairment are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. Changes 
in the provisions are recognized as income/expense in the statement of comprehensive income. 
No impairment loss is recognized during this year.

Trading Assets 
Trading assets are those assets that the bank acquires principally for the purpose of selling in the near term, or holds as part of a portfolio that is 
managed together for short-term profit. Trading assets are initially recognized and subsequently measured at fair value in the statement of financial 
position with transactions cost recognized in income and expenditure. All changes in the fair value are recognized as part of the net trading income in 
income and expenditure. 







At reporting date, the bank's outstanding contract for a non-deliverable forward contract asset (NDF) was of Rs. 103,880,000. The bank has a policy 
to maintain a square-off position on such derivative contracts with exception a certain degree of risk tolerance. 




Property, Plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises 
purchase price including non-refundable duties and taxes; and any directly attributable cost incurred in bringing the asset to their present 
location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management but excluding trade discounts 
and rebates. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will 
flow in to the Bank. Ongoing repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred. If significant part of an item of property, Plant or equipment has 
different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, Plant and equipment. 
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, Plant and equipment (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal 
and carrying amount of the items) is recognized within other income in Statement of profit and Loss Account. 

Land is not depreciated. All other property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date they are available for use or in respect of self- 
constructed assets, from the date that the construction is completed and ready for use. Depreciation is charged on straight-line method over 
the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed on each reporting date and adjusted 
if required.

In order to fair present the grant assets' economic benefits over its useful lives, non-current assets acquired under the government grant is 
recognized as "Grant Assets" and included under respective head of property, plant and equipment with corresponding credit to "Deferred Grant 
Income" under the head of Other Liabilities. 



 Goodwill and Intangible assets 
Banking Software 
Intangible assets include software purchased by the bank. The intangible assets that are acquired by the bank and have definite useful lives are 
measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment losses. Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed 
immediately as incurred. Subsequent cost on software is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific 
asset to which it relates. Bank has a policy to amortize banking software at 20% on straight line basis. 
Other Intangibles 
Other Intangibles are recognized at cost and subsequently amortized at 20% on straight line basis. 
Investment Property 
Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both but not for sale in the ordinary course of 
business, used in the supply of services or for administrative purpose. Investment property is measured initially at cost. After initial recognition 
investment property shall be measured at its cost (NAS16 Property Plant and Equipment) less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment unless the investment property meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale as per (NFRS 5) Non-current Assets held for sale. 
Investment property includes land, land and building acquired as non-banking assets by bank but not sold. On reclassification into Property and 
Equipment, its carrying value or recoverable value whichever is lower is considered as its cost for subsequent accounting. 
Income Tax 
Income Tax expense comprises of current and deferred tax. It is recognized in Profit or loss except to the extent that relate to items recognized directly 
in equity or in other comprehensive income (OCI).

During the year bank has reversed the interest income for Rs. 100 million as described in Note no. 4.29 and 5.12. Such interest is deducted from 
interest income and shown under current liabilities (interest payable). However, income tax is paid on reversed interest. 
3.10.1 Current Tax 
Current tax comprises of expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the payable or 
receivable in respect to previous years. Current tax is measured using tax rate enacted or subsequently enacted at the reporting date. 

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary difference between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the tax base of these assets and liabilities as per the legislation. Deferred tax is measured using tax rate enacted or subsequently enacted 
at the reporting date. 

Deposits and borrowings are the source of funds of the bank in addition to its reserves. These are initially measured at fair value minus direct 
transaction cost and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except where the bank designates liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss. 
Subordinated Liabilities 
These are the liabilities subordinated, at the event of winding up, to claims of depositors, debt Securities issued and other creditors. It shall include 
redeemable preference shares, subordinated notes issued, borrowings etc. 


A provision is recognized if as a result of a past event, the bank has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting (in case of non- 
current) the expected future cash flows at the pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as finance cost. 
3.13 Revenue Recognition 
3.13.1 Interest income 
Interest income/expenses are recognized in Profit or Loss using the effective interest method. 
Bank uses Accounting Standard Board of Nepal carve- outs and treats coupon rate as effective interest rate. 
However, interest accrual is suspended and is not recognized as Interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss in following circumstances: 
Loans where contractual payments of principal and/or interest are more than 3 months in arrears and where the net realizable value of 
1. 
security is insufficient to cover payment of principal and accrued interest. 
Loans where contractual payments of principal and/or interest are more than12 months in arrears, irrespective of the net realizable 
value of collateral. 
Overdraft and other short-term facilities which have not been settled after the expiry of the loan and even not renewed within 3 months 
of the expiry, and where the net realizable value of security is insufficient to cover payment of principal and accrued interest. 
Overdrafts and other short-term facilities which have not been settled after the expiry of the loan and even not renewed within 12 months 
of the expiry, irrespective of the net realizable value of collateral. 




Fees and Commission income that are integral part on determining effective interest rate on a financial asset or liability are included in effective 
interest rate. Other Fees and commissions are recognized separately as the related service is performed or received. All fees and commissions 
are not considered for computation of effective interest rate considering immaterial or impracticable to determine reliably. 

Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive is established. A right to receive is considered to have been established when the entity 
makes a formal announcement for dividend declaration. 

Net trading income comprises gains less losses relating to trading assets and liabilities and includes all realized and unrealized fair value 
changes, and net income from financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or Loss. All gains and losses from the changes in the 
fair value of financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value are recognized through profit and loss. Interest income and expenses and 
dividend income arising on these financial instruments are also included, except for interest arising from debt securities issued by the bank, 
and derivatives managed in conjunction with those debt securities which is recognized in Interest expense. 

Net income from other financial instrument at fair value through profit and loss related to non-trading derivatives held for risk management 
purposes that do not form part of the qualifying hedge relationships are recognized through profit or loss. It includes realized and unrealized fair 
value changes, interest, and dividend income and foreign exchange differences.

Interest Expenses 
Interest expense is recognized in Profit or Loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rates that exactly discount 
estimated future cash payment through expected life of the financial instrument or where appropriate a shorter period, to the net carrying amount 
of the financial liability. While calculating the effective interest rate, the Bank estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial 
instrument but excluding future credit gains. The calculation includes all amount paid by the bank that are an integral part of the effective interest rate 
of the financial instrument, including the transaction costs and other premium or discounts. 
Bank uses ASB carve- outs as mentioned in 2.7 above and treat coupon rate as effective interest rate. 



A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays a fixed contribution to a separate entity and 
has no legal or constructive obligation to pay future amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as 
employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which the related service are rendered by employees. Pre-paid contributions are 
recognized as an asset to the extent that cash refund or reduction in future payments is available. Contributions to a defined contribution plan 
being due for more than 12 months after the end of the period in which the employee render the service are discounted at their present value. 
The following are the benefit plans provided by the bank to its employees: 
1) 
Defined Contribution Plan: All permanent employees are entitled for participation in employee Provident Fund (Retirement Fund) 
wherein the employees contribute at 10 percent of their current basic salaries. The bank contributes 10% of basic salary to this fund, 
which is separately administered as a defined contribution plan as per Bank Staff By-Law. The bank’s obligations for contributions to 
the above fund are recognized as an expense in Statement of profit or loss as the related services are rendered. 
Defined Benefit Plan: A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other thana defined contribution plan. The bank’s 
net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned in return for their service in current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. 
Any unrecognized past service costs and the FairValue of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting 
date on corporate bonds, that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the bank's obligation and that are denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. 
The calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The bank 
recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans immediately in other comprehensive income and all expenses 
related to defined benefits plans in employee benefit are expensed in profit and loss account. When the calculation results in a potential 
assets for the group, the recognized assets is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds 
from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits consideration is given 
to any applicable minimum funding requirements. 
Measurements of the net defined benefit liability comprise actuarial gains and losses. The return on plan assets (excluding interest 
income) and the effect of the assets ceiling (if any excluding interest) are recognized immediately in OCI. The bank determines the net 
interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined 
benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefits liability (assets), taking into account any changes 
in the net defined benefits liability (asset) during the period as a result of contribution and benefits payments. Net interest expenses and 
other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in personal expenses in Statement of profit and Loss. 
The following are the defined benefit plans provided by the bank to its employees: 
1) Gratuity 
2) Staff Security Fund 
3) Leave Encashment 
4) Medical Facilities 





The termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of which the bank can no longer withdrawn the offer of those benefits and when the 
bank recognizes costs for restructuring. If benefits are not expected to be wholly settled within 12 months of the reporting date, then they are 
discounted. 





Short term employee benefits are expensed as the related services are provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid if 
the Bank has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employees and obligation 
can be estimated reliably and settled within12 month period.

to its customers at the rate agreed at the time of loan agreement adjusted with change in the base rate from time to time. During the current fiscal year, other commercial 
banks in the industry has reduced interest income due to excess interest premium charged to its customers. The bank has to identify additional interest amount charged to 
specific customers due to excess interest premium, if any. Accordingly, the bank has reduced interest income by Rs 10 crores with corresponding amount as interest payable 
to customers. Customer-wise identification of this excess interest premium will be completed and settled within the upcoming fiscal year 2079-80.

Credit risks are the risk associated with the probability of default of loan provided by the bank. Hence, the credit risks comprise of the highest 
risk exposure of the bank. Management of the credit risks largely signifies the risk management of the bank as whole. 
Agricultural Development Bank Ltd. 
+s ln= 
s[lif ljsf; a} 
Credit risk: 
a. 
Is measured as the amount which could be lost if a customer or counterparty fails to make repayments. In the case of derivatives, the 
measurement of exposure takes into account the current mark to market value to the Bank of the contract and the expected potential change 
in that value over time caused by movements in market rates; 
Is monitored within limits, approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities. 
Is managed through a robust risk control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for credit risk 
management. 
b. 
c. 

The board of directors assumes overall responsibility for the oversight of credit risk. A separate Bank Credit department, reporting to the bank board, 
is responsible for managing the bank's credit risk, including the following. 
a. 
Formulating credit policies in consultation with business units, covering collateral requirements, credit assessment, risk grading and reporting, 
documentary and legal procedures, and compliance with regulatory and statutory requirements. 
Establishing the authorization structure for the approval and renewal of credit facilities. Authorization limits are allocated to business unit 
Credit Officers. Larger facilities require approval by Regional Offices, Credit Department, Loan Portfolio Management Committee or the board of 
directors as appropriate. 
Reviewing and assessing credit risk: Bank assesses all credit exposures in excess of designated limits, before facilities are committed to 
customers by the business unit concerned. Renewals and reviews of facilities are subject to the same review process. 
Limiting concentrations of exposure to counterparties, geographies and industries: For loans and advances, financial guarantees and similar 
exposures, centrally a limit is established. 
Developing and maintaining the bank's risk grading to categories exposures according to the degree of risk of financial loss faced and to focus 
management on the attendant risks. The risk grading system is used in determining where impairment provisions may be required against 
specific credit exposures. The current risk grading framework reflects varying degrees of risk of default and the availability of collateral or other 
credit risk mitigation. The responsibility for setting risk grades lies with the final approving executive or committee, as appropriate. Risk grades 
are subject to regular reviews. 
Reviewing compliance of business units with agreed exposure limits, including those for selected industries, country risk and product types. 
Regular reports on the credit quality of local portfolios are provided to provincial offices, Credit Department and the Loan Portfolio Management 
Committee which may require appropriate corrective action to be taken. 
Providing advice, guidance and special skills to business units to promote best practice throughout the Bank in the management of credit 
risk. 






Each business unit is required to implement bank's credit policies and procedures, with credit approval authorities delegated from the Credit 
Department. Each business unit has a Credit Risk Officer who reports on all credit-related matters to local management and the Credit Department. 
Each business unit is responsible for the quality and performance of its credit portfolio and for monitoring and controlling all credit risks in its portfolios, 
including those subject to central approval. Regular audits of business units and credit processes are undertaken by Internal Audit Department. 


Impairment assessment methodology 
The Bank first assesses individually whether objective evidence of impairment exists for financial assets that are individually significant. When an 
account is classified as default or when the Bank no longer expect to recover the principle or interest due on a loan in full or in accordance with the 
original terms and conditions, it is assessed for impairment. If exposures are secured, the current net realizable value of the collateral will be taken 
into account when assessing the need for an impairment allowance. When the net present value of the collateral is sufficiently adequate to cover the 
outstanding facilities, impairment is not calculated for such cases. 
In the event Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, it includes the asset in a 
group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics such as product type, collateral type, past due status and other relevant factors and

+s ln= 
s[lif ljsf; a} 
collectively assesses them for impairment. However, assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or 
continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. 
Due to scattered portfolio with no significant coverage of total portfolio from individual customer, bank has considered collective impairment 
methodology only. 
Bank has used ASB carve-outs to compute the provision against loans and advances due to which, the amount of provision to be created against 
Loans and Advances shall be higher of: 
a. 
b. 
Impairment allowance on loans and advances as per NRB directive 2 and paragraph 63 of NAS 39 is as stated in the table below. Out of two, 
impairment allowance as per NRB directive 2 is higher so it has been booked in the financial statement. 
Impairment calculated as per Impairment Assessment Methodology as described above or, 
Loan Loss Provision calculated as per the provisions of Directive No. 2, Nepal Rastra Bank unified directives.

Write off /write-back of loans and receivables 
Loans (and the related impairment allowance) are normally written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Where 
loans are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realization of security. In circumstances where the realizable value of any 
collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, write off may be earlier. 
During the FY 2078/79 bank has recovered the written off loan and interest (i.e. write-back) for the sum of Rs. 35,839,135. 
5.1.2 Market Risks 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads (not relating to 
changes in the obligor's/issuer's credit standing) will affect the bank's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of the 
bank's market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters to ensure the bank's solvency while 
optimizing the return on risk. 
Management of Market Risks 
The bank separates its exposure to market risks between trading and non-trading portfolios. Treasury department of bank is responsible for managing 
the market risk. Bank sets up limits for each type of risk in aggregate and for portfolios, with market liquidity being a primary factor in determining the 
level of limits set for trading portfolios. The bank's Risk Committee is responsible for the development of detailed risk management policies (subject to 
review and approval by Board) and for the day-to-day review of their implementation. The bank employs a range of tools to monitor and limit market 
risk exposures. 
5.1.3 Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering 
cash or another financial asset. 
Management of Liquidity Risk 
The bank's board of directors sets the bank's strategy for managing liquidity risk and delegates responsibility for oversight of the implementation of this 
policy to Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO approves the bank's liquidity policies and procedures. Treasury Department manages 
the bank's liquidity position on a day-to-day basis and reviews daily reports covering the liquidity position of the bank. A summary report, including 
any exceptions and remedial action taken, is submitted regularly to ALCO. 
The bank's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when 
they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the bank's reputation. The key 
elements of the Bank's liquidity strategy are as follows. 
a. 
Maintaining a diversified fund base consisting of customer deposits (both retail and corporate) and wholesale market deposits and maintaining 
contingency facilities. 
Carrying a portfolio of highly liquid assets, diversified by currency and maturity. 
Monitoring liquidity ratios, maturity mismatches, behavioral characteristics of the bank's financial assets and financial liabilities, and the 
extent to which the bank's assets are encumbered, and so not, available as potential collateral for obtaining funding. 
Carrying out stress testing of the bank's different types of risks. 
d. 
Treasury Department receives information from other business units regarding the liquidity profile of their financial assets and financial liabilities 
and details of other projected cash flows arising from projected future business. Treasury Department then maintains a portfolio of short-term liquid

assets, largely made up of short-term liquid investment securities, loans and advances to banks and other inter-bank facilities, to ensure that 
sufficient liquidity is maintained within the Bank as a whole. Regular liquidity stress testing is conducted under a variety of scenarios covering both 
normal and more severe market conditions. The scenarios are developed taking into account both bank-specific events (e.g. a rating downgrade) and 
market-related events (e.g. prolonged market illiquidity, reduced fungibility of currencies, natural disasters or other catastrophes). 
5.1.4 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities 
Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or 
market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. 
However, the objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same – to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset 
or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price 
at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). 
Fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy: 
Level-1 inputs 
Valuation technique using quoted market price: financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets that the group can 
access at the measurement date. Held for trading and available for sale investments have been recorded using Level 1 inputs. 
Level-2 inputs 
Valuation technique using observable inputs: financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for 
identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable. 
For the listed securities where the bank holds promoter shares which are priced and traded differently in the market than ordinary shares the bank 
has considered the valuation of promoter shares as the last traded price of the promoter share or the price of ordinary share whichever is lesser. 
Level-3 inputs 
Valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs: financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant 
inputs are unobservable where market prices are not available then the bank considers the carrying value and future cash flows from the financial 
instruments. 
For unlisted securities where observable market data are not available, Net Assets Value (NAV) of such securities is considered as the best estimate 
of fair value. 
Information on financial instruments carried at fair value and their position in the fair value hierarchy is presented below.

The bank's lead regulator, Nepal Rastra Bank, Central Bank of Nepal, sets and monitors capital requirements for the banking industry as a whole. 
The capital requirements of the lead regulator are based on the Basel III framework. The Bank has been granted approval by its lead regulator to 
adopt the standardized approaches to credit and operational risk management. The bank's regulatory capital comprises two tiers. Tier 1 capital, 
which includes ordinary share capital, share premiums, retained earnings, translation reserve after deductions for goodwill and other regulatory 
adjustments relating to items that are included in equity but are treated differently for capital adequacy purposes. 
Tier 2 Capital, which includes perpetual bonds, qualifying subordinated liabilities, collective impairment allowance (limited to those credit 
portfolios for which the standardized approach is used) and the element of the fair value reserve relating to unrealized gains and losses on equity 
instruments classified as available for sale. Various limits are applied to elements of the capital base. For example, the qualifying Tier 2 capital 
cannot exceed Tier 1 capital; and qualifying term subordinated loan capital may not exceed 50% of Tier 1 capital. Other deductions from capital 
include the carrying amounts of investments in subsidiaries that are not included in the regulatory consolidation and certain other regulatory items. 
Banking operations are categorized as either trading book or non-trading book, and risk-weighted assets are determined according to specified 
requirements that seek to reflect the varying levels of risk attached to assets and exposures not recognized in the statement of financial position. 
The bank's policy is to maintain a strong capital base to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future development of 
the business. The impact of the level of capital on shareholders' return is also recognized and the bank recognized the need to maintain a balance 
between the higher returns that might be possible with greater gearing and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. The 
bank and its individually regulated operations have complied with all externally imposed capital requirements.

When an entity first recognizes a financial asset, it classifies it based on the entity’s business model for managing the asset and the asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics, as follows: 
• 

o The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and 
o The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest 



 Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income—financial assets are classified and measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income if they are held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. 
 Fair value through profit or loss—any financial assets that are not held in one of the two business models mentioned are measured at fair 



All financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities include 
derivatives (other than derivatives that are financial guarantee contracts or are designated and effective hedging instruments), other liabilities held 
for trading, and liabilities that an entity designates to be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
